# UltimateTemplate

An empty Ableton Live project file, set up for a fast production workflow.

Two templates are provided, **Ultimate Template** and **Simple Template**.

**Ultimate Template** has everything divided into groups by default and requires some proprietary plug-ins.

Each group has at least 1 MIDI and 1 WAV group. The perc group has many different audio tracks, one far left, one mid left, (etc.), one huge verb, one delay, one wide, etc. There is a dedicated resampler at the top, and a group for my ghost kick and ghost snares, which drive the sidechains which are attached to every appropriate group already. Each group also has an EQ, a glue compressor, a filter, and a utility. Master has my mixing/mastering chain (disabled by default), as well as a few effects/filters for playing with the master channel. You'll also see that I have a "sound design" group so I can jam on sounds without getting in the way of the other groups, and I have a 'sections' track for building colored MIDI clips to mark the different sections (build/drop/bridge) of the track. Everything is color coded, from ultraviolet bass to infrared sizzle.

**Simple Template** keeps the same colors, but does not separate tracks into groups or include a sidechain compressor on anything. It also uses 100% stock Ableton plugins.
