# UltimateTemplate

An empty Ableton Live project file, set up for a fast production workflow.

Three templates are provided, **Ultimate Template**, **Simple Template** and **Middle Template**.

**Ultimate Template** has everything divided into groups by default and requires some proprietary plug-ins.

Each group has at least 1 MIDI and 1 WAV group. The perc group has many different audio tracks, one far left, one mid left, (etc.), one huge verb, one delay, one wide, etc. There is a dedicated resampler at the top, and a group for my ghost kick and ghost snares, which drive the sidechains which are attached to every appropriate group already. Each group also has an EQ, a glue compressor, a filter, and a utility. Master has my mixing/mastering chain (disabled by default), as well as a few effects/filters for playing with the master channel. You'll also see that I have a "sound design" group so I can jam on sounds without getting in the way of the other groups, and I have a 'sections' track for building colored MIDI clips to mark the different sections (build/drop/bridge) of the track. Everything is color coded, from ultraviolet bass to infrared sizzle.

**Simple Template** keeps the same colors, but does not separate tracks into groups or include a sidechain compressor on anything. It also uses 100% stock Ableton plugins.

**Middle Template** is like the baby bear of the group. After using both of the others, this is the one I settled down into using. Percs are grouped, there are a few effects thrown on here and there, and everything is stock Ableton so it's low-CPU by default. It also includes marked "sections" for the into and drop of a particular Rage Logic song I like.

## Using as Default

_From 9.7.3 onwards_: Open up one of these projects, modify to your personal taste, then open up Ableton's preferences, and from the "File Folder" Tab, hit "Save Current Set as Default". Now every new Set you start will have this awesome template!
